- **Dynamic states**: Shows alert or all-clear states based on entity conditions
- **Fully customizable**: Override any visual element directly in the card config
- **Compact & Clear**: Shows only what you need to know at a glance

## üì¶ Installation

### HACS Installation (Recommended)

1. Go to **HACS > Frontend > Custom Repositories**
2. Add this repo:
   ```
   https://github.com/Pjarbit/combined-notifications-card
   ```
3. Choose **Lovelace** and click **Download**
4. Restart Home Assistant
5. Go to **Settings > Dashboards > Resources** and verify this is added:
   ```
   url: /hacsfiles/combined-notifications-card/combined-notifications-card.js
   type: module
   ```

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Pjarbit/combined-notifications-card/releases)
2. Copy the `combined-notifications-card.js` file to your `www/` directory
3. Add the resource to your dashboard:
   ```yaml
   url: /local/combined-notifications-card.js
   type: module
   ```
4. Restart Home Assistant

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Usage

Add the card to your dashboard with this minimal configuration:

```yaml
type: custom:combined-notifications-card
entity: sensor.car_alert_notifications
```

That's it! The card automatically inherits all styling and behavior from the sensor entity created by the Combined Notifications integration.

## üé® Customization Options

You can override any default display settings from the sensor using these attributes:

| Attribute | Description | Examples |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `header_name` | Custom card title | `Car Alerts`, `Lighting`, `Home Security` |
| `text_all_clear` | Message when all clear | `All OK`, `All Clear`, `Systems Normal` |
| `background_color_all_clear` | Background for normal state | `green`, `blue`, `teal` |
| `background_color_alert` | Background for alert state | `red`, `orange`, `yellow` |
| `icon_all_clear` | Icon for normal state | `mdi:hand-okay`, `mdi:check-circle` |
| `icon_alert` | Icon for alert state | `mdi:alert-circle`, `mdi:alert` |
| `icon_color_all_clear` | Icon color for normal state | `white`, `gray`, `var(--primary-color)` |
| `icon_color_alert` | Icon color for alert state | `yellow`, `red`, `white` |
| `show_details` | Show entity details | `true`, `false` |
| `hide_when_clear` | Hide card when all clear | `true`, `false` |

## üìã Example Configuration

```yaml
type: custom:combined-notifications-card
entity: sensor.car_alert_notifications
header_name: Car Alerts
text_all_clear: All Systems Normal
background_color_all_clear: green
background_color_alert: red
icon_all_clear: mdi:check-circle
icon_alert: mdi:alert-circle
show_details: true
hide_when_clear: false
```

## üß† How It Works

### Behavior
When any condition is triggered:
- Card background changes to your alert color
- Displays your alert icon
- Shows a list of unmet conditions

When all conditions are normal:
- Card switches to your all-clear color
- Displays your custom "All Clear" message
- Shows your all-clear icon

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- If the card isn't appearing, check that you've added the JS file to your resources
- Verify that the integration is properly set up and creating sensor entities
- Ensure the entity name in your card configuration matches exactly with the sensor created by the integration
- Check your browser console for any JavaScript errors
